Many miles southeast of the Imperial capital lies the Lifespring, a natural phenomenon that has turned the surrounding area into extremely fertile farmland. What was once an endless expanse of vibrant forest was transformed into a valley filled with miles and miles of farmland, interspersed with only the occasional grove of the original forest.

The Emperor himself determined the Lifespring Province to be of critical importance to the Empire and gave it to the Lifesong Family to manage. The Lifesong Family was quick to cut down extensive areas of forest, leaving just enough to support a stable population of beasts. Because the Lifespring was extremely attractive to powerful beasts, the Lifesong Family raised a series of mountains, imbedded with arrays, to form a fortified valley.

Alexander was born to a family of farmers in the Lifespring Province. While they were not rich, Alexander’s family was in no way poor, and they owned a small amount of land. Alexander grew up playing in his family’s fields. Once, while he was playing, he discovered mudwater, the source of the land's prosperity. 

The Lifespring is no normal spring. Instead of releasing water it releases mudwater, a liquid stone that contains a shocking amount of life energy. The mudwater then flows from the Lifespring to all corners of the Lifespring Province. 

Alexander loved playing with the mudwater, and at an early age he developed the ability to solidify it into stone. His parents were surprised, considering they could not solidify mudwater until much later, after they received tutelage from their own parents. 

By the time he was seven, Alexander was making small huts and detailed statues from mudwater. In the Lifespring Province, all children his age were taught basic techniques and the properties of mudwater in a public school. Alexander was no exception and was sent to school by his parents. Almost immediately his talent with mudwater was discovered and, with his parent’s permission, he was sent to Lifespring City, where his talents could be better developed.
