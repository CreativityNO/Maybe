“Another rebel, huh?”

“Yes, my Emperor. They have gotten bolder over the last century. Perhaps another demonstration of your power is necessary.”

“Hmm. The project is almost complete, isn’t it?”

“Although I am not aware of the details, I believe it is, my Emperor.” 

“I will enter seclusion for a decade to put the finishing touches on the project. Start preparing for the celebration of the Empire's first millennium. The main event will take place in the Capital.”

“Of course, my Emperor. If that is all, then I will take my leave to begin preparations.”

“You are dismissed.”

  

All around the planet, citizens of the Empire began preparations for the celebration of the Empire’s first millennium. From the Imperial Capital to the smallest of villages, every settlement was a hive of activity. 

Though not all were preparing for a celebration. In the dark alleys and remote settlements, some spoke of rebellion. Many still bitter about the Empire’s conquest of their homeland, and others ambitious, with their gazes set on the throne. The Emperor is growing old, they whisper, he is no longer who he once was. After all, it was common knowledge that the Emperor was older than the Empire itself. Surely no one could live that long without any sign of advancement.

Soon the celebration was just months away. People rushed to complete their preparations. The Imperial Capital was bursting at the seams as people from all corners of the Empire came to see the Emperor himself give a speech. This would be the first time the Emperor appeared in public in decades.

  

Finally, the day came. All around the planet, the festivities began. Though they all paled in comparison to the Imperial Capital.

The best mages in all the Empire worked together to create a light show like no other. Each mage was striving to outdo their peers and showcase their prowess. Streaks of color filled the sky; golden dragons did battle with crimson phoenixes under a great verdant tree that towered over them both. A giant of stone punched at an indeterminate form of shadow as an eye of flame looked down at both. A thousand and one displays rose, covering every inch of sky above the capital.

At the very heart of the Imperial Capital stood the Emperor’s Palace. Made of a dark stone interspersed with white. Above the Palace there were only five projections. A simple spear that emitted such intense bloodlust the very air grew agitated in its presence. A sun that emitted a blinding golden light that healed all touched by its rays. A simple tree that seemed to contain the secrets of life and death. A sword the color of open seas that cut the very space around it. And finally, above them all, a stylized eye so solid it was as if it were truly carved from the purest white jade and not a construct of energy. Unlike the other projections, the eye did nothing but cause a faint haze around it, a testament to the amount of energy that went into its creation.

After a few minutes most of the projections died down, and the rest grew less distinct as the mages sustaining them sought to preserve their power for the next portion of the celebration. Though the ones above the palace did not fade, their effect on the world around them faded, as the ones granting their family crest significance left to observe the next segment. Only the eye remained unchanged.

Around the palace, Imperial Guardsmen flew above the crowd, clearing out a large area of empty ground. Then a man wearing brown robes emblazoned with the image of a stone giant walked out from the crowd and made his way to the center of the clearing. In his right hand he held a staff made of brown stone topped with a great opalescent pearl. With one motion he raised his staff into the air, and suddenly the edges of the clearing rose into the sky. The once flat clearing was transformed into a stone stadium. 

Half of the stadium was instantly filled in as the Four Great Families and their subordinates made their way into the stadium. Not long after, the entire stadium was packed to the brim with people squeezed shoulder to shoulder. Each of the Four Great Families was quick to transform their area of the stand to better suit their liking.

The stands of the Warborn Family darkened until they were a deep crimson. Above them, the simple spear that was once wielded by their Matriarch was projected. Next to them, the Brightcrown Families' stands were transformed into marble. The golden sun shone above them, an imitation of their Patriarch's famous skill. Sections of stone transformed into dirt as the Lifesong Family grew plants to shade them from the sun. Projected above them was the tree that their Matriarch planted long ago, which still stands at the heart of their residence in the Capital. Finally, the stands of the Oceansblade Family transformed into a deep aquamarine. Above them hung the projection of their Patriarch's famous blade.

As the crowd and the Four Great Families settled in, another mage walked into the center of the stadium. He was wearing a light blue robe emblazoned with a silver mirror. In his hands he carried the very mirror on his robes. In one smooth motion, he threw the mirror into the air. As the mirror reached the apex of its flight, it flashed and disappeared. All along the outside wall of the stadium and within every major gathering place within the Capital, the same silver mirror appeared, projecting the inside of the stadium. Within every major city, a larger version of the mirror also appeared, broadcasting the event to the entire Empire.

Finally, an announcer made his way into the stadium. A hushed whisper washed over the crowd. Even the members of the Four Great Families looked surprised. The announcer had the appearance of an older man with a slightly wrinkled face and white in his hair. He had no notable features except one. His eyes were not flesh and blood but made of carved white jade. He was an Eyeless.

The Eyeless are each personally taught by the Emperor. Each one of them was personally selected and evaluated by the Emperor. And only after meeting the Emperor's expectations will they remove their own eyes and replace them with eyes of jade they craft themselves. It is said to be extremely painful, as the process involves not just physically removing the eyes but removing the soul's memory of the eyes, making the change unhealable. It will be as if they never had eyes in the first place.

“I am Wide Eyes, an orphan from the streets of the Capital," the announcer said, “and if not for the Emperor’s grace, I would not be here today, and neither would any of you. Today we celebrate the founding of the Empire and its continued existence. It is my pleasure to announce today's events. Within this stadium, the greatest talents of the Empire will compete. Each winner of one of today's competitions will be allowed to take one artifact from the Emperor's own stores. First up, combat for the younger generation.”

And so the competitions began. First, the members of the younger generation dueled, then the older generation. And after came the crafting competitions. The day passed quickly, and soon, as the last of the competitions concluded, the sun finally brushed against the horizon. 

The crowd and the Four Great Families exited the stadium as the brown robed mage once again made an appearance. Soon there was no sign that there ever was a stadium there. As the crowd rushed to fill the empty space, the Four Great Families rose into the air. Hovering above the crowd, they formed a semicircle surrounding the Palace.

And as the sky lit up with reds and oranges from the setting sun, the Emperor exited the Palace. He was dressed in simple robes of white and gold, a stark contrast to his traditional red and black. Upon his head rested his crown, made of a dark metal intertwined with veins of red. Set into the crown, above the Emperor’s forehead, was a ruby. The ruby was so perfect, its color was so rich, it was as if it had been condensed from blood and not a natural gem. 

The Emperor himself was an unremarkable man. His face only showed the slightest sign of wrinkles and his hair only slight signs of graying. His eyes, however, were as white as the purest jade. While the Eyeless carve the iris and pupil, the Emperor had only faint, almost invisible, gray lines to mark their existence. For the Emperor’s eyes were not carved of jade but of flesh and blood.

With a tap of his foot, the Emperor flew into the sky. Below him, a platform of solid energy formed, and he stood upon it. Floating ever higher, the Emperor finally stopped as he surpassed the highest point of the Palace. And with another tap of his foot, the platform expanded, growing large enough to hold dozens of people.

From the Palace, two dozen Imperial Guardsmen appeared, lining up behind the Emperor. Then four more people flew from the palace. They lined up beside the Emperor, each looking forward with eyes of jade. Among them, standing on the Emperor’s right, was Wide Eyes.

Below, the crowd once again parted as a dozen mages walked through. Led by the mage with the silver mirror, they all wore the same light blue robe emblazoned with the image of a silver mirror. Stopping a short distance from the edge of the crowd, they began to carve runes on the floor. Once done, the mages formed a circle with their leader facing the Emperor. Once again, he tossed the mirror into the sky. However, as the mirror reached the apex of its flight, all the mages chanted at once.

“Let all the world, **See**!”

All the runes on the floor flashed and burned away as the mirror released a blinding flash of light. As the mirror disappeared, the very sky itself began reflecting the Emperor and his procession. All around the world people looked up and saw not the ever-present sky but the Emperor.

“Citizens of the Empire! A thousand years ago, I founded the Empire with four of my closest companions with the dream of one day uniting the entire planet. Barely a century ago, we made that dream a reality. So now we may ask ourselves, where do we go from here? Less than ten percent of our planet is inhabited. Go forth and explore this world; make a name for yourself. Stagnation leads to weakness, and weakness leads to death. The Empire will never stop moving forward. For the past decade, I have been putting the finishing touches on a project that has been centuries in the making.”

At that, the Emperor reached up and, in one smooth motion, tossed his crown into the air. Time seemed to slow as it flew through the air, spinning ever so slightly. And, just as it started to succumb to gravity, it exploded into an uncountable number of shards. They rained down on the audience like a million shooting stars. A few seconds later, the shards disintegrated into essence that dissipated into the air.

From his robes, the Emperor drew out a new crown. This one was forged from the purest gold, interspersed with carvings of white jade. Set into the center was an oval, milky white gem. Carved ever so slightly into the gem was a vertical pupil, only visible if the light hit it just right.

Carefully, the Emperor set the crown upon his head. With a leap the Emperor flew even higher until the crowd were nothing but faint specks on the ground. He reached out with his hand as if to grab the air. Closing his eyes, he slowly began to close his hand into a fist.

“I am the Emperor and all the world will be **Mine**!”

All around the world, humongous pillars of metal rose into the air, covered in runes glowing a brilliant white. Around the Capital eight of those pillars rose, towering over every building. The Emperor continued slowly closing his fist as sweat began to form on his brow. Deep beneath the palace, within the Emperor's forge, a small pillar of gold rose from the floor.

Though, as the last of the pillars rose to their full height, the Emperor was beginning to slow and eventually stopped. The Emperor gave a grunt of effort as he forced his hand to continue closing. With that grunt, all the pillars collapsed into rivers of molten metal. The rivers snaked through the air and through the ground, interconnecting until they formed a complex pattern covering the entire planet.

With the rest of the pillars, the pillar of gold collapsed into a river of molten gold. But instead of spreading out, it burrowed deep into the planet, going straight down. Down it went, till it reached the very center of the planet, the World Core. The liquid gold flowed around the World Core, forming even more complicated patterns.

Just as he was about to close his fist, the Emperor faltered, and his progress stalled. With a shout, he was no longer wearing robes but flowing golden armor decorated with carvings of white jade. The armor lit up as lines of white snaked through it. His crown too lit up, the gem in the center shining bright enough to act as a second sun. The Emperor gave one final roar as he closed his fist.

“**MINE**!”

At that, all the molten metal flashed, then disappeared. The molten gold, however, fused with the World Core, leaving golden lines all over its surface. For a few moments, it was as if the Emperor had control of every speck of energy on the planet. Then he released his fist, dropping ‌back onto his platform, and the world returned to normal.

“But alas, I must end this day with a bit of unfortunate news. I have ruled long enough, and this planet is far too weak for me to continue advancing. I will wear the crown for a thousand more years, then I will abdicate.”

And at that, the Emperor retreated into his palace. The crowd buzzed with discussion, and everyone had their own opinion of the day's events. But soon the crowd dispersed, returning to the festivities.

  

The Emperor walked slowly through the halls of his palace, his feet letting out not even a whisper as they hit the floor. In the distance, he could hear the faint clicking made by his automatons as they did various chores within the palace. It had been centuries since anyone else had lived in the palace. Back then, the palace had housed him and his companions, and their families. But ever since his companions moved on, he has found no one worthy of living in the palace. Not a single member of the Four Great Families lived up to their ancestors, and none of the Eyeless wished to live in the house of their Emperor.

After walking through nearly a mile of empty halls, he finally arrived at his quarters. Slowly he pushed open the simple wooden door, revealing a small room with nothing but a bed, a desk, and a chair. Sitting on the chair beside his desk, the Emperor looked at the papers scattered on his desk. They were covered in sketches and calculations, many of which were scratched out. Sighing, he slowly removed his crown and armor, setting them down on his bed.

He’d done it. He remembered, over a thousand years ago, joking about it with his friends, a way to allow one person to control all the energy on the planet. Back then, it was a simple thought experiment, a joke about his incredible talent for energy control. Now it had become so much more–his last gift to the people of his home planet, a way for them to protect themselves in his absence. 

A vast array, formed from the energy flows of the world itself, bound to the World Core and connected to his crown and armor. The one wearing the crown and armor will be able to control the energy of the entire planet. Although extremely taxing even for him, it also granted the wielder incredible power. And perhaps one day an array spirit will form, one bound to the World Core, an artificial World Spirit under the control of whoever wears the crown and armor.

The Emperor looked up, staring at the dark stone of the ceiling. For almost a thousand years he had been ready to take the next step, to leave this world behind. But he had stayed for all that time, working on something that he won’t even be able to use. And now he was going to stay a thousand more, to raise a competent successor. 

Leaving his room, he walked, ever so slowly up his palace until he reached the very top. There he looked up at the night sky. Today was a moonless night, so he could truly see the uncountable number of pinpricks of light in the sky. Right now it would be so easy, leap up and leave the world behind, but he had made his promises and he would not betray them.

“Soon, my friends, a thousand more years, then I will finally be able to see you again.”
